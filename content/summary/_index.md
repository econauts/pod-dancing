Pod Dancing is a game about gender norms, and how society limits, labels, and controls people. We will explore these themes through role-play and dancing. Set in an alternate world with four genders in the early stages of its Industrial Revolution, Pod Dancing investigates how gender roles and relationships adapt to a rapidly changing society. It is a Nordic re-design by Julia Pilowsky of an American LARP written by Sharone Horowit-Hendler, Kate Fractal, and Alon Levy.

In the game, players will build a new set of four genders together, with guidance from the game-masters. Then they will play characters of these genders at a Victorian-era courtship ball, like those in *Pride and Prejudice.* This way, they will get to experience what it is like to live and love as someone of the gender they just created.
