Pod Dancing is a game about gender, multi-partner relationships, and an industrializing society. Set in an alternate world with four genders in the early stages of its Industrial Revolution, Pod Dancing investigates how gender roles and relationships adapt to a rapidly changing society. It is a Nordic re-design by Jules Pilowsky of an American LARP written by Sharone Horowit-Hendler, Kate Fractal, and Alon Levy.

In the game, players will build a new set of four genders together, with guidance from the game-masters. Then they will play characters of these genders at a Victorian-era courtship ball, like those in *Pride and Prejudice.* This way, they will get to experience what it is like to live and love as someone of the gender they just created.
