The venue has automatic doors, and the LARP is located on the ground floor, which we hope will help players with mobility issues. If there is anything else you need to know about the venue's accessibility, please contact the game-masters.

Jules has adapted the dances used in Pod Dancing to accommodate the needs of disabled players before, and will be happy to do so again. There is a dedicated section of the sign-up to make these requests.
