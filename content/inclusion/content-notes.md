The game-masters want you to ensure you will not play on any themes that may upset or trigger you. Therefore, we would like to provide some content notes.

The following themes will be part of the game for all players, and if they are not for you, this is not your game: gender stereotyping, religion, shame and repression of sexuality, strict enforcement of gender norms, oppressive class systems, and romance.

The following themes are part of the game for some characters, but you can request a character that avoids these themes if they are not for you: PTSD, gender dysphoria, mourning a loved one, disability, and xenophobia.
